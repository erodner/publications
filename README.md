# Publications

This is the publication repository of the computer vision and machine learning group at HTW Berlin.

## Some rules to preserve consistency
* special characters and the & are NOT allowed!
* use full names as author names seperated with the word "and" instead of commas
* use {\"u}, {\"a}, {\"o} to specify Umlaute
* use the note field for text like "to be published", "submitted", etc.
* if you have the word Award or award in the note field, additional highlighting is added automatically
* keep all entries up to date with page number specifications etc
* add the abstract of a paper to the abstract field in the entry
* PDFs and teaser images have to be placed in ``/home/dbv/publications`` with the name corresponding to the BibTex key used
* Springer is fine with PDFs of the publications on your own personal page or a research group page. However, you should add a link to their webpage (or a similar reference) in the PDF. Limited and paid access to publications is simply something, nobody should accept anymore in research.
* link to the source code of your project with the ``code`` keyword in the BibTex entry
* you can even add HTML to your abstract to for example link to your supplementary material or to other example images
* Naming of Conferences:
  *No "Proceedings of th Xth ..." doesn't matter at all... :)
  * For IEEE conferences, add IEEE before "Conference on ..."
  * add the commbon acronym in brackets, e.g., IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)
  * Workshop Proceedings: Conf-Acro Workshop on foo and bar (ConfAcro-WS), e.g., ECCV Workshop on Parts and Attributes (ECCV-WS)
* Important for journal articles: add the 'volume' and the 'number' (i.e. issue) entry! A 'volume' entry without a 'number' entry will be ignored in the visualization.
* Windows users: Use Linux-style newline characters!
